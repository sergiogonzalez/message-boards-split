# Message Boards Split View for Liferay 7

As part of Liferay DXP the Message Boards changed the User Interface merging both categories and threads in the same set of data. Originally in 6.2 and 6.1 they were treated as independent entities. These modules changed the User Interface in Liferay 7 so it behaves as it did in 6.2 or 6.1.
